### Step 3: Modify the config.js Configuration File in the Current Directory

```javascript
const config = {
    // Set the number you want to mint here. It is recommended not to exceed 50 at a time, otherwise it may not be successfully recorded on the chain.

    repeatCount: 1,

    // Increase by how many times on the current gas base.
    increaseGas: 1.2,

    //  Your wallet's private key.
